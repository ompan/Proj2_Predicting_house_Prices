**## House Price Prediction using Linear Regression**

_Project Title: House Price Prediction Model_
Description:
This project builds a simple linear regression model to predict house prices based on features like the number of bedrooms and square footage.
Dataset
The dataset used in this project contains information about the number of bedrooms, square footage, and house prices. The dataset can be synthetic or from a real-world source (I created a synthetic one myself).
Requirements
Make sure you have the following libraries installed before running the code: /*pip install pandas scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn*/
Features :
bedrooms: Number of bedrooms in the house.
square_footage: Total square footage of the house.
price: Price of the house (target variable).
Files :
house_prices.csv: CSV file containing the house price data.
linear_regression.py: Python script that contains the code for training the linear regression model and visualizing results.
